## SHAEDIT: Space Hadron Accelerator Experiment Data Investigation Tool

This is a Jupyter notebook for conveniently viewing and comparing the data collected from the measurements of double-differential secondary particle yields from intermediate-energy hadrons incident on thick-targets. These experimental measurements were made at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory on the Brookhaven National Laboratory campus.

This is not the final release of SHAEDIT.  Some of the datasets are still preliminary or under investigation, and minor feature updates will likely be implemented.

### Feature updates
* Text files for each of the plotted spectra can now be viewed in the notebook.
* These text files can be downloaded individually or downloaded together in a ZIP archive.
* Figures can now be saved as PDF or PNG via the save plot buttons.

### Datasets which are not final
* Deconvoluted back target-produced neutrons may change as the methodology is finalized and systematic uncertainty quantification continues.
* NaI charged particle data from the November 2017 experiment is undergoing substantial reworking and debugging; present data for those sets are not to be presently trusted (though some spectra look alright).
* OLS charged particle data from the November 2017 experiment, while mostly final, will be receiving a slight update in the future improving high energy portions of the spectra.
* MCNP results for OLS charged particles from the November 2016 and 2017 experiments suffer from a normalization error which will be fixed in a future release.
