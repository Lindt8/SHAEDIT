Space Hadron Accelerator Experiment Data Investigation Tool

This is a Jupyter notebook for conveniently viewing and comparing the data collected from the measurements of double-differential secondary particle yields from intermediate-energy hadrons incident on thick-targets. These experimental measurements were made at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory on the Brookhaven National Laboratory campus.
