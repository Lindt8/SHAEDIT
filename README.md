### Space Hadron Accelerator Experiment Data Investigation Tool

This is a Jupyter notebook for conveniently viewing and comparing the data collected from the measurements of double-differential secondary particle yields from intermediate-energy hadrons incident on thick-targets. These experimental measurements were made at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory on the Brookhaven National Laboratory campus.

Either download the contents of this repository and launch the Jupyter notebook file locally or visit this notebook online at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Lindt8/SHAEDIT/master.  Note that this site can be quite slow to load (sometimes taking 2+ minutes) or not working at all.  Once it has loaded, click the ``SHAEDIT.ipynb`` file/link, which will open the notebook in a new tab, follow the instructions at the top of the page, and enjoy looking at the data with SHAEDIT!
